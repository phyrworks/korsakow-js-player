   These files are usually the same for all films. They describe the default layout and logic for films.
    * index.html
    * data/css/
    * data/js/
* Dynamic content

    These files are specific to a given film.
    * data/image/
    * data/video/
    * data/subtitle/
    * data/thumbnail/

        These folders contain the media played in a film.
